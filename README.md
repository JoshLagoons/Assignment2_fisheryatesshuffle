# Assignment2_fisheryatesshuffle
Was able to incorporate an external file by making a list of words I wanted my code to pick up and shuffle, I make the txt file then plug it in into the debug folder for it to obtain the data for the code to read the file and then use the help from our material this week to incorporate my concept for it. The fisher yates shuffle is an algorithm that creates a random arrangement that is in a finite sequence, basically shuffling the sequence every time and it's in the name too. By the randomization of getting like a arrangement of letters being in order and one is picked, it gets swapped with the letter it's taking its place and then goes to next letter to do the same process. In which I was able to accomplish with the words I incorpirated to randomize and be in a different placement everytime you boot up.
